# WESSTEC

This is an implementation of the WESSTEC model. The repository contains the java code (labeled data generation module) as well as python code (Wide&Deep module). We will also publish trained embedding models as well as the datasets. 

Upon publication, we will prepare a much more elaborate README file. 

## How to run the code
**Running inside Eclipse**
This project is based on [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). So it could be easily imported to Eclipse. For importing it the Eclipse should contain [Buildship Plugin](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship).  After installing [Buildship Plugin](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship), you can easily import the project into the Eclipse as a Gradle project.

## Components of WESSTEC
WESSTEC consists of two main modules: 
(1) a data labeling module, which computes probabilistic labels for a given unlabeled training data set, and 
(2) a classification model based on a Wide & Deep learning approach.

## (1) Labeled Data Generation
This module aims to generate labeled documents from a given label list and unlabeled set of documents. To generate labeled data user should run:
`/src/main/java/org/fiz/ise/gwifi/WESSTEC/LabeledDataGeneration.java` 
The output of this class is labeled documents which can be leveraged for the categorization task.

## (2) Wide&Deep model
To perform the short text categorization task with the Wide&Deep model, users should run: `keras_wide_deep.py`
