  <text>UCI bosses refuses to be drawn on Contador caseThe head of cycling's world governing body has refused to make any comment on the provisional suspension of three-time Tour de France champion Alberto Contador for a doping violation.Pat McQuaid, who attended the UCI Congress meeting in a downtown Melbourne hotel on Friday, told The Associated Press he was "completely limited" in what he could say, so "I'm saying nothing."Contador was provisionally suspended Thursday after a World Anti-Doping Agency lab in Germany found a "very small concentration" of the banned substance clenbuterol in his urine sample taken on July 21 at the Tour.The Spanish rider has said the positive doping test must have resulted from contaminated meat he'd eaten.</text>
