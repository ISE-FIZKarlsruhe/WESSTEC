  <text>Chinese manufacturing gains speed in OctoberChinese manufacturing accelerated in October as spending on infrastructure projects spurred a jump in new equipment orders, a survey showed Monday.The state-affiliated China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said its purchasing managers index, or PMI, rose to 54.7 in October from 53.8 September and 51.7 in August. Monthly readings have stayed above 50, the benchmark for expansion, for 20 straight months, it said.China's economic growth slowed to 9.6 percent in July-September over a year earlier, down from the previous quarter's 10.3 percent.But the survey, an indicator of future trends, suggests the economy is on track for continued stable growth, the federation said in a notice on its website.It said the relatively robust reading for October showed strong growth in new orders for equipment, including transportation and general equipment thanks to strong stimulus spending.China's spending on new projects rose 24.5 percent in the first nine months of the year to 13.9 trillion yuan ($2.1 trillion), more than twice the amount of total investment in new projects in the same periods of 2007-2008.The jump in spending prompted the central bank to raise key interest rates last week to help counter inflation.Industries showing expansion in manufacturing in October included non-ferrous metals, printing, metal products and paper making, the federation said.The survey's measure for new export orders remained flat, reflecting weakness in overseas economies."The long term may carry greater liquidity risks, with financial risks linked to huge loans coming due for U.S. banks," it said.The survey also warned of risks from surging prices for key raw materials, such as cotton and rubber.</text>
