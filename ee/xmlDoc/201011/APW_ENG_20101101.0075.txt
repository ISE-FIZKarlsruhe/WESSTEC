  <text>Allott quits as New Zealand Cricket GMNew Zealand Cricket general manager Geoff Allott quit his position Monday, saying he was at odds with his organization over its high-performance strategy.The former international fast bowler appeared to be the first casualty of last month's disastrous tour to Bangladesh by a New Zealand team beaten 4-0 in a one-day series.New Zealand Cricket decided, after a lengthy review, to keep the current management structure of the national team, including coach Mark Greatbatch, captain Daniel Vettori, manager Dave Currie and high performance director Roger Mortimer.Mortimer was formerly an athletes' agent with no specialist knowledge of cricket. Currie, chef de mission of New Zealand Olympic and Commonwealth Games teams, also comes from a non-cricketing background.In a statement announcing his resignation, Allott said it had become clear to him that New Zealand Cricket would allocate resources to high-performance areas other than those he felt deserved priority."This was reinforced to me during the recent review following the Bangladesh tour," he said."I believe our elite athletes and teams need a combination of the best available high-performance expertise and the knowledge of cricket experts who understand the technical aspects of the game."</text>
