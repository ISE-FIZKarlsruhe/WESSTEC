  <text>Indonesian volcano unleashes new powerful eruptionIndonesia's most volatile volcano -- one of 22 being closely watched following an increase in activity -- unleashed its most powerful eruption in a deadly week Monday, spewing searing clouds of gas and debris thousands of feet (meters) into the air. There were no immediate reports of new casualties.Hundreds of miles (kilometers) to the west, meanwhile, a break in weather was helping rescuers get aid to victims of an 18-foot (six meter) -high tsunami that slammed into several remote islands, sweeping entire villages to sea.The twin disasters, occurring simultaneously on opposite ends of the seismically charged country, have killed nearly 500 people in the last week, severely testing the government's emergency response network.In both cases, the military has been called in to help.Mount Merapi, one of nearly 200 active volcanoes in Indonesia, has erupted many times in the last two centuries, often with deadly results. In 1994, 60 people were killed, while in 1930, more than a dozen villages were incinerated, leaving up to 1,300 dead.Thirty-eight people have died since the notoriously unpredictable mountain sprang back to life one week ago.Almost all villagers living along Mount Merapi's fertile slopes have been evacuated to crowded refugee camps well away from the base, some screaming and crying as they were carried away by camouflaged soldiers.During lulls in activity, some have returned to their homes to check on livestock and crops, but there were no indications any had been hurt in Monday's blast, said Waluyo Rahardjo, a National Search and Rescue Agency official.The eruption was accompanied by several deafening explosions.As massive clouds spilled from the glowing cauldron and billowed into the air -- with no sign of slowing nearly three hours after the blast -- debris and ash cascaded nearly four miles (six kilometers) down the southeastern slopes, said Subrandrio, an official charged with monitoring Merapi's activity.More than 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) to the west, meanwhile, a C-130 transport plane, six helicopters and four motorized boats were ferrying aid to the most distant corners of the Mentawai Islands, where last week's tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes, schools, churches and mosques.A military chopper also evacuated badly injured survivors Sunday who had languished in an overwhelmed hospital with only paracetamol to ease their pain, said Ade Edward, a disaster management official. Among them was a baby girl born in a shelter after the tsunami and a 12-year-old girl with a life-threatening chest wound.Relief efforts were brought to a halt Saturday by stormy weather and rough seas."We're really glad to finally see the relief workers, doctors and rescue teams able to reach devastated areas," Edward said, adding that two navy ships arrived with many more police and soldiers deployed to speed up relief efforts.The tsunami death toll had reached 450 by Monday, said Nelis Zuliastri from the National Disaster Management Agency, with the number of missing now less than 100.Indonesia, a vast island nation of 235 million people, straddles a series of fault lines and volcanoes known as the Pacific "Ring of Fire" and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.There is some debate as to whether seismic activity like the 7.7-magnitude quake that spawned last week's tsunami can trigger volcanic eruptions. But with Merapi's eruption 24 hours after that tremor, the government wasn't taking chances.It has raised alert levels of 21 other volcanoes -- many of which have shown an increase in activity, rumbling and belching out heavy black ash -- to the second- and third- highest levels in the last week, mostly as a precaution, said Syamsul Rizal, a state volcanologist."Given all the seismic activity in this region, it isn't especially unusual or even new to have all these mountains going at the same time," he said. With temperatures constantly fluctuating, lava domes building up and collapsing, "it's as always, something to watch.""But Merapi is making us all more attentive."------Associated Press writers Achmad Ibrahim in the Mentawai islands and Niniek Karmini, Irwan Firdaus and Ali Kotarumalos in Jakarta contributed to this report.</text>
